<%= simple_form_for [@restaurant,@review] do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :content %>
  <!-- adds bootstrap button  -->
  <%= f.submit class: 'btn btn-primary' %>
<% end %>

<!-- this will generate a form with action 'reviews' only! -->
<!-- will return error: undefined method `reviews_path'  -->
<!-- which is just /reviews and we don't have that in our routes -->
<!-- in our routes we have: -->
<!-- /restaurants/:restaurant_id/reviews
/restaurants/:restaurant_id/reviews/new -->
<!-- we need action '/restaurants/:id/reviews/new' -->

<!-- we dont have any references added to our restaurant model. We need
to get the id!! -->

<!-- WHAT TO DO: -->
<!-- - find restaurant in the reviews controller; -->
